# Usage
Open the application.
Select the options you want for your password (length, character types).
Click "Generate Password."
Copy the generated password to your clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button.
# Code Overview
The project is organized into three main files:
gen.html: Contains the structure of the application.
gen.css: Provides styling for a clean and responsive design.
gen.js: Implements the password generation logic and event handling.
# How It Works
Password Generation: The application builds a string of allowed characters based on user choices and randomly selects characters from it until reaching the desired length.
Copy Feature: Once generated, the password can be copied directly to the clipboard with a button.
